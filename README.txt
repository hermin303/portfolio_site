# portfolio_site

This project consists in creating a web page, the structure of the website was provided by designer that previously built the mockup of the website.

## Structure
To build this project, we proceeded through the following steps:
  - we created the folders of the project: `portfolio_site` as the project's main folder.
  - Inside the main folder we created a folder to put all the sketches we drew for building the webpage, we called this folder `sketch`. 
  - And inside `portofolio_site` we create the `resources` folder that embraced all the important folders of the webpage: `css` for css stylesheets, `img` for images that will be on the webpage, and `doc` for pdf documents that will be part of the page as well. 
  - The `css` folder has the `style.css` which is the main stylesheet for the webpage structure, texts, titles, the media elements and the mobiles features for the different responsive versions of the webpage.
  - The main file of the webpage is named `index` and it is inside the main folder `portfolio_site`. This page contains many HTML tags because we were inclined to build a real structure of the webpage instead of putting only `div` in the webpage's structure. 

## Installation
For this program to run, we:
 - use a web browser (Chrome in my case)
 - the chrome development tool to test and adjust styles in elements and components of the webpage. 
 - the Mozilla development tool to test and manage the layout of the responsive designs of the webpage. 

## Challenges
On the way of building this website, the challenges we met were:
 - the main challenge I found was converting the page into responsive. 
 - as usually recommended, I was using the traditional numbers of 480px, 768px and 960px as references for my breakpoints and the webpage was not rendering a visual friendly layout at all. 
 - to overcome this challenge, I did use the Mozilla development tool to test several breakpoints and realized that 610 px, 810px, and above 960px were the natural patterns to follow for the responsive designs of the webpage.
